<p>Updated the content of this for excerpt testing... STEM employment has launched itself into today’s popular discourse as it continues to outpace overall employment growth. With STEM at the heart of the future of employment, here are some common misconceptions you should know about working in the field:</p>

<h2><strong>Misconception #1: Careers in STEM lack room for creativity.</strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p> </p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While those first entering the job market may hold a vision of STEM careers as being mechanical environments behind large computers and in cold labs, STEM positions leave plenty of room for innovation and creativity. Today’s constant state of advancement has companies eagerly vying to be the newest and most innovative. Thus, working in STEM can actually be full of creativity and excitement as employees help companies work towards competing in the global market and shape the ever-changing technological future.</p>

<h2><strong>Misconception #2: STEM workers only work in STEM-related fields. </strong></h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p> </p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although STEM professionals may think their skills would be better utilized in a strictly STEM-related industry, the truth is that all companies rely on STEM talent. Whether it is in finance, analytics, programming, design, or research, STEM talent is needed everywhere. In fact, food and retail industries are increasingly searching for workers in computers and IT as the popularity of online shopping and delivery continues to grow. </p>

<h2><strong>Misconception #3: All STEM fields are male-dominated</strong>.</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->
<p> </p>
<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although women still remain underrepresented in STEM overall, significant progress has been made in certain fields. A study conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that in the United States women make up three-quarters of all health-related jobs and nearly half of all life science and math-related jobs. Although women still remain underrepresented in the fields of engineering and computers, the increasingly high demand for STEM talent lends itself to greater future representation.</p>
