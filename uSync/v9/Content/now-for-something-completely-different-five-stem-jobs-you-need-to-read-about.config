<p>Although many think of STEM in its greater break down
of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, if you further explore
these fields you may find that there are careers in STEM you may have never
even heard of or thought about, such as:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Underwater
Archaeologists</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exploring sunken pirate ships and ancient submerged
cities, underwater archaeologists get to combine the fields of history,
anthropology, chemistry, and information science in their work. Undergoing
extensive dive training and receiving education in quantitative and qualitative
research methods, these professionals seek to understand the cultural,
historical, and physical characteristics of humans through the study of materials
found underwater. Diving to sites to make observation and collect data and
samples, and then returning to the lab to conduct research and unveil
information, underwater archaeologists get to conduct both lab and field world.

<p><strong>Cartographers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s advancing technologies have transformed the
world of map-making, creating positive job outlooks for cartographers. Between
2016 and 2026, employment of cartographers and photogrammetrists is expected to
grow approximately 20 percent. As the field has become heavily intertwined with
technology and geographic information systems (GIS), cartographers are using
various methods of data acquisition, geoprocessing tools, design technology,
spatial analysis, etc. to update and create interactive digital maps. From
rideshare apps and navigation systems to intelligence and urban planning,
cartographers are at the head of the burgeoning map user interface that have
become a part of our everyday lives. </p>

<p><strong>Forensic
Linguists</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Often combining aspects of biology, psychology,
computer science, anthropology, and much more, linguistics is an extremely
interdisciplinary field. In the world of forensic linguistics, these aspects
are also combined with law and criminology. Forensic linguists often work with
law enforcement and judicial branches to consult on cases ranging from police
interviews to legal disputes over plagiarism. Using their knowledge of speech,
dialects, tone, spelling, word-choice, etc. forensic linguists conduct
systematic analysis on language to aid their clients in furthering
investigative information.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cosmologists</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Not to be confused with
cosmetology, cosmology under the umbrella of astronomy and astrophysics,
cosmology is the study of the universe, its origins, structure, and evolution. As
new information about the universe is constantly being unveiled, cosmology is
an ever-evolving field. An occupation predominantly housed in the fields of
research and academia, cosmologists often have doctoral degrees in physics,
astronomy, or other related fields. Cosmologists continuously explore and
develop theories pertaining to the universe as they work to advance scientific
tools and technology, conduct research, and gather new data. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Industrial-Organizational
Psychologists</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Industrial-organizational
psychologists apply their psychological expertise to the work place. Hired
across a wide range of institutions such as schools, hospitals, government
agencies, and small and large businesses, most industrial-organizational
psychologists have at least a master’s degree in psychology. Industrial-organizational
psychologists play an important role in maintaining the health and productivity
of an organization. In observing both individual and organizational behaviors
across various working environments, these specialized psychologists work to evaluate
and suggest the best strategies to optimize work efficiency as well as to improve
the quality of life of both the employers and the employees. </p>
