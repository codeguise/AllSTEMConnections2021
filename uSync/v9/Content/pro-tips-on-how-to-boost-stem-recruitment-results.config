<p>From using and monitoring social media, product design and analytics,
to key aspects of corporate social responsibility (CSR), companies today are
increasingly recognizing that hiring STEM
talent is crucial to their business. They’re also finding out that this is
easier said than done. Thanks to low unemployment and often still-new
psychographics<sup>1</sup> associated with hiring and retaining most STEM
professionals, many employers are struggling to evolve and adapt their
recruitment processes to effectively draw in the STEM talent they need. Below
are three tips from successful STEM recruiters:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Relevance: Matter to Millennials and Gen Y-ers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are the first
generations to grow up not knowing a world without the internet. High speed
access to answering virtually any question is expected in this demographic.
More often than not, they will dig deep to evaluate prospective employers –
they will try to parse what your company culture is by poring through your
social media presence, check your CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility)
initiatives, and, yes, judge how you compare to your competitors. Use your
social media innovatively – show off the good you are doing for your community
and the world, and how you encourage your employees to live their best lives. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the largest age
segment in the STEM talent pool, Millennials and Gen Y<sup>3</sup>
professionals should be solid guideposts in formulating your recruitment
strategy. Determine what they value in employers that you can offer. Flex time,
telecommuting, career mobility and a robust and meaningful recognition and
rewards program count among some of the most popular checkboxes on their wish
lists. </p>

<p><strong>Reserves: Build a Pipeline</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When it comes to STEM
talent, ‘just-in-time’ (JIT) recruiting, often means ‘too late’. To hire top
STEM talent, smart employers must now incorporate the need for STEM
professionals in their recruiting process.<sup>2</sup> Realizing they need to
act not only fast but proactively, many strategic employers have begun to build
a pipeline of talent by engaging with STEM students before they are on the
market:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Connect with colleges and universities by offering sponsorships or even career workshops that give students an enticing peek into your industry and more importantly, your      organization.</li><li>Offer internships for STEM positions to engage and evaluate future hires for skills as well as cultural fit.</li><li>Implement an employee referral program among your internal staff – as insiders, they have solid insight when it comes to identifying candidates within their social circles would      be great fits.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Reskilling:
Look at What (or Whom) You’ve Got</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Last but far from the
least, the professional and financial gains open to STEM talent is hard to
miss. Examine your internal talent pool for high-potential non-STEM employees
who will welcome the opportunity for self-motivated and company-sponsored
reskilling, internal candidates are typically higher quality, and their skills,
performance and cultural fit have been established. Internal hiring also helps
advance the careers of high performers and increase employees' morale – and
promotes your company as one that nurtures careers and champions growth and
advancement.</p>
