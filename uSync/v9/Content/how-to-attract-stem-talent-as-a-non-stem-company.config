<p>In today’s ever-advancing data and tech filled world,
the need for science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) talent
transcends industries. With this growing need, non-STEM companies are
increasingly finding themselves competing for the same STEM talent as big name
companies. With a recent study showing that 87 percent of middle and high
school students think STEM employment means working for companies such as NASA,
how can your company breakthrough and connect with the STEM talent you need to
be successful? Here are four tips to help your non-STEM company better attract
STEM talent: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Tap
into Alternative Talent Pools</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Because non-STEM companies may not be naturally
attracting the talent they need to fill STEM-related positions, it is important
to keep in mind that there are many pools of great talent that often go
unrecognized during the hiring process. Be open to shifting some of your
company’s traditional hiring strategies to tap into less-traditional talent
streams. Consider looking for your next highly-skilled STEM employee in alternative
talent sources such as freelance or contract workers, open-sourced talent,
part-time candidates, etc. Your company can even build its own candidate pool
by adopting internship/co-op programs that pipeline new hires into the
organization. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Provide
Purpose and Meaning</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>A recent LinkedIn survey of global talent trends
revealed that 74 percent of participating candidates want to pursue a career
where they feel as if their work matters. Whether it’s through promoting strong
company values and ethics, creating a collaborative company culture, or
providing opportunities for social responsibility, smart companies use their purpose
to promote meaning to gain a competitive edge in the talent market. Highlighting
the ways your company provides fulfillment in the workplace can help you
attract and retain STEM talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Re-Vamp
Your Job Postings</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>While job postings are a good way for your company to
screen and filter candidates, they are also tools for candidates to screen your
company. According to Monster, 63 percent of job seekers find that job
descriptions lack adequate information on company culture and values. To ensure
your company is attracting top STEM talent, consider re-vamping your job
postings. Share the character and values of your company in addition to
presenting the position. Take job postings as another opportunity to attract
talent, and not just a general listing of the job requirements. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Offer
Personal Growth and Benefits</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s STEM talent are interested in more than just the
title and salary. Studies have shown that opportunities for personal growth,
benefits, and work-life balance are equally as important when considering a
position. As a recent Gallup poll shows, 87 percent of millennials value
opportunities for professional growth and development. This can be a great selling
point to attract the talent your company needs. Offer training programs,
mentorships, room for internal promotions, etc. Make sure to show candidates the
benefits of being a STEM employee at a non-STEM company, such as greater
autonomy, flexibility, and leadership opportunities. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Attracting STEM talent to a non-STEM company can add a
layer of complexity to the hiring process, but the rewards far outweigh the
challenges. Having the STEM talent need to stay innovative and adapt to change,
means your company will be ready and able to keep pace in a rapidly-evolving,
global marketplace. Looking for expert advice to support your STEM recruiting
goals? AllSTEM can help. </p>
