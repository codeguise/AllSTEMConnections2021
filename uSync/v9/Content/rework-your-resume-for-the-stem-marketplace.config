<p>Whether you are new to the field, or you’ve been
working in STEM before it was referred to as ‘STEM’, you may have some
questions regarding how you should craft your resume for your next science,
tech, engineering, or mathematics job search. Because Hiring Managers in STEM
are often looking for specific skills and style, here are a few general tricks
that can help you properly position your resume for the STEM roles: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Move
Your Skills Toward the Top</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Although sample resumes tend to list skills near the
bottom of the document, for STEM positions it is actually more beneficial to
list your skills towards the top. This is because STEM jobs are often technical
and specialized positions, making your skills one of the first things Hiring Managers
will notice. A recent study by The Ladders found that Hiring Managers spend an
average of six seconds scanning a resume, so listing skills towards the top
will ensure your key qualifications are front and center for them to see. &nbsp;</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Highlight
Research</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are just entering the STEM job market, it is
important to highlight any research you have conducted during your time in
school or elsewhere. Research is often one of the first opportunities STEM
students encounter in regards to obtaining hands-on experience, so highlighting
it will help Hiring Managers better understand the breadth of your abilities. Make
sure to emphasize equipment you have used, important methodologies, or any
published works related to your research. Even if you are not new to the STEM
marketplace, valuable research always looks impressive. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Emphasize
Relevant Coursework</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>If you are new to the job market, use relevant
coursework to supplement your experience. As many skills required in STEM are gained
during your formal education; listing relevant coursework will emphasize to Hiring
Managers that you have received the necessary education in those areas. Choose
and delve into the courses that have provided you with the most applicable
experience relevant to the position you are applying for, and don’t forget to
highlight any important projects or presentations that may be of direct
interest to the Hiring Manager. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Be
Short and Sweet</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With the prevalence of resume scanning software and
the general nature of the STEM market, it is important to not bog down your
resume with too many words. Use succinct language and bullet points to
summarize your skills and experience. This improves your resume’s readability and
your chances of getting noticed by an applicant tracking system (ATS). It is also
important to fine-tune your resume so it is optimized with keywords. These
keywords include active verb statements and skills that match the
qualifications and expectations listed in the job description. &nbsp;</p>
