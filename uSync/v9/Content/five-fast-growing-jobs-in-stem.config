<p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS) most
recent ten-year employment projection reported that 11.5 million jobs are
expected to be available by 2026, roughly a seven percent growth rate over the
previous decade. As the world focuses more on science, technology, engineering
and mathematics (STEM), it is not surprising that most of the fastest-growing
occupations are in STEM. Here are five fast-growing STEM jobs according to the U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics:</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solar
Photovoltaic Installers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the world pushes towards more sustainable forms
of energy, there is now a greater need for solar photovoltaic installers, also
known as PV installers. These STEM professionals install, maintain, and repair
solar panels. Solar photovoltaic installers are by far the fastest-growing
occupation of both STEM and non-STEM jobs, with a projected job growth of 105
percent (11,800 positions)! The median annual salary for PV installers is
$42,680, and the entry-level education required is a high school diploma. </p>

<p><strong>Nurse
Practitioners</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today’s increasing population and extended life
expectancy has spurred a greater need for nurse practitioners who can help administer
patient care. Nurse Practitioners have an entry-level education of a master’s
degree and advanced practice registered nurses (APRNs) are able to diagnose
medical conditions, prescribe medicine, and provide treatment. The projected
job growth for this occupation is 36 percent (56,100 positions) and the median
annual salary is $107,030. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Statisticians</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Modern life is continually bursting with data, of
which only a small fraction is analyzed. As businesses seek employees who can
interpret and analyze this mass amount of data into usable information,
statisticians are increasingly in demand and have a projected job growth of 34
percent (12,600 positions). Statisticians earn a median annual salary of
$87,780 and require entry-level education of a master’s degree. </p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Software
Application Developers</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With today’s increasing use of technology and
continued technological innovation, the job of software application developers
is projected to grow 31 percent (255,400 positions) by 2026. Working to create
and develop application software for smartphones, tablets, computers, and other
electronic devices, software application developers receive a median annual
salary of $103,620 and often have a bachelor’s degree in computer science,
computer programming, or other related fields.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Information
Security Analysts</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cyberattacks pose a risk for all industries.
Businesses are thus in greater need of information security analysts to help
develop and implement online security measures. This is a fast-growing
occupation with a projected growth rate of 28 percent (28,500 positions).
Information security analysts have a median annual salary of $98,350, and
entry-level positions require a bachelor’s degree. </p>
