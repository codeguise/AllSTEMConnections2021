<p>While
the digital age is driving innovation at a furious pace, it is creating a
talent vacuum for STEM professionals that companies are increasingly struggling
to fill. With the STEM talent shortage recently described by businesschief.com
as “<a href="https://www.businesschief.com/leadership/8167/What-can-tech-businesses-do-to-address-the-STEM-skills-shortage">reaching
crisis point</a>,” is there something
that organizations can do to attract, recruit, and retain the STEM workers they
need? </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The
answer is yes, and it starts with learning what the key challenges to
recruiting and retaining STEM workers are – and how to address them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hurdle 1: The Talent
Pool is Too Small</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Recent studies showed that seven
out of 10 employers are struggling to attract and recruit STEM talent. Not
surprising, since STEM talent is a much smaller and sought-after group in a job
market that, thanks to low unemployment, heavily favors candidates.
Fortunately, the STEM talent pool appears small only because it is still
largely untapped.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution A: Practice Deliberate Inclusivity</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Inclusivity is being forward-thinking in the kindest, fairest, and most open-minded way. What’s not to love? Craft, showcase, and be guided by your <a href="https://blog.ongig.com/diversity-and-inclusion/10-examples-of-the-best-diversity-statements">diversity and inclusivity statement</a> to promote your progressive approach. Reevaluate your job ads to check against masculine language that exclude or turn off women (<a href="https://www.wisecampaign.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/WISE_-_Gender_Decoding_Your_Job_Adverts.pdf">wisecampaign.com</a> research found that terms like ‘coding ninjas’, ‘warriors’, and ‘rock stars’ “has resulted in fewer women applying and with a higher quit rate than men”). The beauty of inclusivity is that it improves the very heart of your brand culture as well as expands your recruitment pool.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution B: Incubate Talent
Through Internship</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Employers are increasingly investing in internship programs in an
effort to secure emerging talent before they enter the job market. In addition
to effectively calling dibs to nascent superstars, internship is also a great
way to create positive relationships and brand identity through word of mouth –
particularly among the interns’ peer group and their schools. Of course, there
are many other, more immediate employer perks to be gained from internship: cost-effective
workers who are eager learners, extra hands to finally get those deprioritized
projects checked off, and digital natives who can give your social media
presence a boost.&nbsp; </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hurdle 2: Your Company
Is Out of Touch</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It’s
easy to see how trying to engage and recruit STEM talent could feel like learning
a new language; they are often from a different generation. There’s also that
about-face from what previous generations were taught about job search – it not
about the biggest salary or the most prestigious company and title any more. Think
purpose over paychecks. Nowadays, how you
stand in the community and how it sees you is a major bargaining chip. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution
A: Learn the Lingo</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Tech often involves highly specific terminology that could
spell the difference between a job ad that attracts superstars and one that
gets passed over for several painful days until a totally unsuitable candidate
responds with an application. Learning the ever-changing platforms, systems,
and processes that you’re suddenly hiring people to develop, operate, deploy,
and maintain can be daunting and take up precious time. One workaround would be
to task the open position’s Hiring Manager or supervisor to craft the job ad
and description. For many companies, partnering with a STEM-focused recruiter
is a smart two-fer solution that lets you get a crash-course on the tech
terminologies while having a proven pro quickly zero in on the best candidate. <strong></strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution
B: Up Your Altruism</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Do you support local schools through
sponsorship? Champion LGBTQIA+ rights? Made significant investments to being
‘green’? These are examples of corporate altruism that today’s STEM workers look
for in prospective employers. Opportunities
to make a positive difference to the world and promote quality of life are more
plentiful – and showing great interest and even investing in these strongly
resonate with the new wave of STEM talent.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Hurdle 3: They Are
Considering Other Jobs</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>With STEM workers receiving more job
offers and having more options than ever before, retention is just as much of a
challenge as recruiting. The upside is that,
all tech-speak aside, STEM professionals value and aspire to the same as their
less techy peers: they seek well-defined career paths that will allow them to
stay challenged yet fulfilled and able to put down roots at home. Or, they want
to have flexibility so that they can be there for their families’ defining
moments. Telecommuting? Not necessarily every day, but yes, a definite plus. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution A: Encourage
Ongoing Learning</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>STEM professionals chose their line of work because they
relish the challenge of learning on a constant basis. With high-level STEM
employees being found to receive less ongoing training than their non-STEM
peers, many experts prescribe structured training and development strategies
for companies positioned for growth – and want their tech talent to grow along
with them. This can range from giving them opportunities for further education
through schools, or even relevant workshops and other events, and conversely,
to mentor – whether it is interns, new hires, or much younger students as a
form of branded STEM outreach. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Solution B: Let them Live Their
Best Lives</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the first generation to be fully wired and online, many STEM
workers spent much of their careers working remotely and working flexible
hours. Whether it’s to pursue their passions, or to spend more time with their
families (particularly parents looking to curb daycare costs), not being locked
into a traditional 9-5 work schedule is a highly favored perk. In fact, the
AppleOne SCALE found that 73% of surveyed employees ranked flexible hours as
highly desirable – some would even go as far as to take a pay cut to have it,
but only 37% of employers offer this very appealing, cost-free perk.</p>
