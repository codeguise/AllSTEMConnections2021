<p>STEM candidates are hard to find and job openings take the longest to
fill of all job categories. With many companies still adapting to STEM
employees, these positions also experience higher-than-average turnover.<sup>1 </sup>According
to the <a href="https://www.allswell.com/SCALE/2020/">AllSTEM 2020 SCALE</a>, top
science, technology, engineering, and mathematics talent are off the market in
less than 10 days – and over two-thirds of them don’t even use job boards.<sup>2</sup>
</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many organizations have invested more resources into recruiting passive
STEM talent. Passive candidates aren’t disinterested, rather actively looking
to improve on workforce goals and objectives. Seeking out passive STEM talent
effectively requires showcasing the employment brand and experience. These are
major aspects of an effective STEM sourcing strategy. For the third successive
year, research has found that nearly 60% of employees are planning on leaving
their jobs within 12 months.<sup>3</sup> Strategic Hiring Managers and Recruiters
know it’s smart to build visibility with this transient, hungry, and motivated
passive talent. Data shows that passive candidates perform 9% better than unemployed
new hires, and are 25% more likely to stay in an organization. Passive
candidates are more selective about accepting an employment offer, more honest
about their compatibility and interest in the employment opportunity, and may
have been specifically sought out by Recruiters for best-fit opportunities.<sup>4</sup>
So, how are these candidates surfaced when they aren’t actively looking? Here
are three ways to entice STEM talent to come out and seek new work
opportunities: </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Enlist Employees as Corporate Champions</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>It is commonplace to
seek consumer reviews before making final decisions about almost anything
today. Feedback found on Yelp, Amazon, Glassdoor, and other review pages impact
decision making now more than ever before. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Internal employees
are experts on the employment experience in which they work daily, and can
effectively articulate that experience. Employees are also great vehicles to tell
others about an organizations’ employment experience. Enable and mobilize your
organization to share employment experiences in the appropriate mediums. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Research shows that 80% of an individual’s decision
whether or not to apply to a given job is based on information from sources
other than the employer, such as Glassdoor reviews from previous and current employees,
employees’ LinkedIn profiles, and word-of-mouth from friends or professional
contacts who know employees.<sup>5 </sup></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Exhibit elements of
the organizations corporate culture that are interesting and attractive to
targeted STEM networks. Seek opportunities to connect with STEM talent that correlate
with the organizations’ values. Explore the feasibility of flex time, freelancing,
or telecommuting.&nbsp; Perhaps it’s working
in a dog-friendly office for a pet food manufacturer, actively contributing to healthcare
initiatives with an insurance organization, or working directly with diversity
and inclusion consortiums in urban communities. These branding techniques will
help attract and retain STEM talent within any organization. STEM candidates are
attracted to an organization of shared passion, value, and opportunity, not
merely a skills match for a paycheck. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Be a Destination for Success</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Be a destination of
choice for passive STEM talent and position the organization as cutting edge, growing,
with unique educational, volunteer, and advancement opportunities. When seeking
software developers or other IT talent, entice candidates with a renowned
keynote speaker for a public lunch and learn. Want to add to your stable of
amazing analysts? Consider hosting an after-hours open house event or organize webinars
that invite top talent in your industry to participate.<sup>6 </sup>These
events give candidates insight into the organizations culture, introduces candidates
to potential colleagues, and allows the organization to evaluate candidacy
outside the traditional interview format.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Cultivate Prospective Hires</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Missed opportunities
don’t just apply to job seekers. We meet exceptional talent frequently, but
often when we don’t have opportunity for them. Finding STEM talent has become
such a major challenge that many larger organizations have started investing in
talent as early as middle school and high school.<sup>6</sup> STEM talent wants
to feel and see a personal and professional connection to an organization. Start
taking advantage of these fortuitous encounters by always representing the
employment brand, and highlighting the employment experience. Find ways to
continuously brand to desired STEM talent networks, grow and nurture those
networks, and begin the cultivation process earlier. Nurturing every
relationship, even those developed on social media, will strengthen your STEM
network, employment brand, applicant flow, and employee retention.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
