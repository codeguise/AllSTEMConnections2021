<p>When it comes to job satisfaction, factors such as
inclusivity and meaningfulness are playing an increasingly crucial role,
particularly among STEM talent. Including your team – whether they are all
STEM, a mix of STEM and non-STEM, or non-STEM workers looking to welcome a STEM
colleague – in your recruitment process now has a two-fold benefit. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>First, it lets you attract, engage, and hire a much better
fit. With STEM workers found to have high levels of soft skills<sup>1</sup>
such as empathy and partiality for generosity, equality, and emotional
intelligence, seeing the team is involved in hiring its newest member will go a
long way to make a positive impression. Second, team members will provide keen
insight into the culture fit of your potential hires and have a clearer
understanding of the skills the team needs to achieve current and future goals.
Here are four steps to get the best results from team recruitment:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Write Better Job Ads</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As the first ‘encounter’ job seekers have with you, your job
ads sets the tone for how effectively engage the candidates you want – and if
they have the STEM skills, experience and proficiencies you need. Getting team
input<sup>2</sup> when writing the job ad provides valuable insights on what
specific technical skills (software, apps, certain machinery or techniques,
etc.) are must-haves, what preferences would be embraced (post-coding ramen?),
and how to present your employer brand in the best most target-specific light.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Invite Team to
Candidate Interviews</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Having team members participate in the interview phase of
the hiring process can be the quickest way to narrow down your choices and
identify the best candidate. <strong>In STEM jobs like IT, where work is highly collaborative, team interviews
are an effective way to ensure a candidate will fit into the overall dynamic
and culture.<sup>3</sup></strong><strong> </strong>Employees
interviewing prospective hires lend first-hand insight on what specific skills
to look for, and what experiences are most useful. Just as importantly, having
the team participate in the interview means having general and immediate
feedback on how well the candidate would function in your culture and
environment.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Assign Employee
Mentors</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>STEM professional or not, the first day on the job can be stressful.
It’s hard not knowing your way around, where to go with questions, or even
where to eat lunch. Some companies have adopted a ‘Work Sponsor’ or ‘Buddy System’
program, where a more tenured employee mentors the new team member. In addition
to helping the new hires find their bearings more easily (and more pleasantly),<sup>3</sup>
this also has the benefit of making current employees feel valued and trusted
enough to mentor newcomers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>Team Recruitment’s
Bonus Benefit:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In addition to helping ensure better hires, the innately
inclusive practice of incorporating the team into your recruiting process can
help in the retention of current team members.<sup> 4</sup> By making them
active players in the growth of the team and even the company, they are likely
to become more engaged from having their opinions and tenure valued and
trusted.</p>
